1 Nephi | 3:7-8
And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, 
for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that 
they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.
